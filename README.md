# Retro Weather Dashboard

## Description
The purpose of this assignment was to create a weather dashboard to show weather information across the globe. Using the OpenWeather API, I was able to create the dashboard. The dashboard shows the current weather, and also the weather for 5 days into the future  (all data updates every 10 minutes automatically).

All of the acceptance criteria are met, but I am happiest with the card for the current weather. I think it looks the cleanest of all of the elements I created on the page.

Hope you enjoy the product, it is meant to be viewed in full screen but mobile works to the best of my ability!
